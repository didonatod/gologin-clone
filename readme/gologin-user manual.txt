6.  "Use Proxy" Toggle
o   Enables or disables proxy usage for this profile.
Why Use a Proxy in GoLogin?
‚Ä¢   Helps avoid detection by using different IPs.
‚Ä¢   Prevents account bans when managing multiple accounts.
‚Ä¢   Allows geo-targeting (e.g., using an IP from another country).
‚Ä¢   Enhances privacy by hiding your real IP address.
‚ÄÉ
The "Timezone" tab in GoLogin allows you to configure how your browser profile handles time zone settings. This helps maintain a consistent digital fingerprint that matches your proxy location and prevents detection.
________________________________________
Elements & Functions in the "Timezone" Tab
1.  "Use Timezone from IP" (Default Option)
o   Automatically sets the timezone based on the proxy's IP location.
o   Ensures your browser fingerprint matches your IP, reducing detection risk.
2.  Manual Timezone Selection (Dropdown)
o   Allows you to manually select a specific timezone.
o   Useful if you want a different timezone from your proxy location.
3.  GMT Offset Display
o   Shows the current GMT offset (e.g., GMT+2, GMT-5).
o   Helps confirm whether the selected timezone aligns with your proxy.
4.  DST (Daylight Saving Time) Handling
o   Some locations adjust for Daylight Saving Time (DST), affecting time accuracy.
o   The system will adjust accordingly if ‚ÄúUse Timezone from IP‚Äù is enabled.
________________________________________
Why is the Timezone Setting Important?
‚Ä¢   If your IP address is from Germany but your browser timezone is set to the U.S., websites may detect this mismatch and flag your activity as suspicious.
‚Ä¢   Keeping the timezone consistent with your proxy makes your browser fingerprint more natural.
‚ÄÉ
The "Extensions" tab in GoLogin allows you to manage browser extensions within your profile. This helps customize functionality, automate tasks, and enhance security.
________________________________________
Elements & Functions in the "Extensions" Tab
1.  Add Extension (Button)
o   Allows you to install new browser extensions for this specific profile.
2.  Installed Extensions List
o   Displays all currently installed extensions.
o   You can enable, disable, or remove them as needed.
3.  Upload CRX File
o   Lets you manually upload a .crx file (Chrome extension format).
o   Useful for installing custom or private extensions not available in the Chrome Web Store.
4.  Enable/Disable Extensions (Toggle)
o   Allows you to turn extensions on or off without uninstalling them.
________________________________________
Why Use Extensions in GoLogin?
‚Ä¢   Automate tasks (e.g., bots, form fillers).
‚Ä¢   Enhance security (e.g., VPNs, ad blockers).
‚Ä¢   Improve productivity (e.g., password managers, autofill tools).
‚Ä¢   Bypass website restrictions (e.g., user-agent switchers).
Would you like me to explain the "Bookmarks" tab next? üìë

________________________________________
Why Use Bookmarks in GoLogin?
‚Ä¢   Quickly access frequently used sites.
‚Ä¢   Maintain separate bookmarks for different profiles (e.g., work vs. personal).
‚Ä¢   Ensure consistency when managing multiple accounts.
Would you like me to explain the "WebRTC" tab next? üîÑ
‚ÄÉ
The "WebRTC" tab in GoLogin allows you to configure WebRTC settings to prevent IP leaks and enhance privacy.
________________________________________
Elements & Functions in the "WebRTC" Tab

o   Available if "Manual Configuration" is selected.
o   Lets you set a specific WebRTC IP for the browser profile.
3.  Check WebRTC (Button)
o   Tests whether WebRTC is leaking your real IP.
________________________________________
Why is WebRTC Important?
‚Ä¢   WebRTC can expose your real IP even when using a proxy or VPN.
‚Ä¢   Websites can detect inconsistent WebRTC settings, leading to potential bans.
‚Ä¢   Custom WebRTC settings help blend your fingerprint naturally.
Would you like me to explain the next tab or any specific feature? üîç
‚ÄÉ

The "Geolocation" tab in GoLogin allows you to control how your browser profile reports its physical location to websites. This helps prevent mismatches between your proxy IP and geolocation data, reducing detection risks.
________________________________________
Elements & Functions in the "Geolocation" Tab
1.  Geolocation Mode Selection (Dropdown)
o   Defines how the browser reports location to websites. Options include:

o   Lets you manually set latitude, longitude, and accuracy (meters).
4.  Test Geolocation (Button)
o   Verifies if the selected settings are working correctly.
________________________________________
Why is Geolocation Important?
‚Ä¢   Websites detect mismatches between IP and location (e.g., IP shows Germany, but location is in the U.S.).
‚Ä¢   Keeping geolocation consistent with your proxy helps prevent account bans.
‚Ä¢   Some sites use geolocation for content access, so manual control can bypass regional restrictions.
Would you like me to explain the "Navigator" or the next tab of your choice? üåç
‚ÄÉ

________________________________________
Why Are These Advanced Settings Important?
‚Ä¢   Websites use fingerprinting techniques to track users even if IP addresses change.
‚Ä¢   Altering these settings prevents browser-based tracking without breaking website functionality.
‚Ä¢   Randomized fingerprints help avoid detection when managing multiple accounts.

// Add noise to Canvas fingerprint
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillText = function(text, x, y) {
  const noiseX = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
  const noiseY = Math.random() * 2 - 1;
  CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.fillText.call(this, text, x + noiseX, y + noiseY);
};
